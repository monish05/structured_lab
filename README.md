# âš¡ EV Insights Dashboard â€” Powered by Preswald

An interactive, data-rich electric vehicle analytics dashboard built entirely using **Preswald**, a product of StructuredLabs.

This dashboard highlights my ability to quickly understand and apply Preswaldâ€™s declarative design model, custom layout components, and SQL-based data querying. It also demonstrates thoughtful use of the frameworkâ€™s flexibility to build a user-friendly and insight-driven application.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Purpose

This project was developed as part of an interview submission to StructuredLabs to showcase:

- My ability to understand and extend Preswald's API and philosophy
- Skill in building composable, modular dashboards with modern UX
- Effective application of SQL and Plotly within the Preswald environment
- Practical use of Preswaldâ€™s sidebar, slider, data querying, and configuration tools

## ðŸ§  How I Used Preswald Beyond the Basics

While Preswald offers a smooth on-ramp, I aimed to **go beyond the example-driven use** by:

- Designing a flexible layout with chart types tailored to the data's narrative (e.g., pie chart for powertrain breakdown, line charts for growth trends)
- Using the `sidebar()` not just for layout but as a visual anchor for branding and navigation
- Replacing traditional dropdowns with a `slider()` to give smoother filtering experience
- Structuring queries and visuals modularly, allowing them to adapt to user inputs without redundancy
- Applying SQL to filter, group, and clean data within Preswald's declarative structure

I made use of the following documentation from the [Preswald GitHub repository](https://github.com/StructuredLabs/preswald):

- [Sidebar Layout](https://github.com/StructuredLabs/preswald/blob/main/docs/layout/sidebar.mdx)
- [Slider Input](https://github.com/StructuredLabs/preswald/blob/main/docs/layout/sizing.mdx)
- [Querying CSV Data](https://github.com/StructuredLabs/preswald/blob/main/docs/data/query.mdx)
- [Display Components](https://github.com/StructuredLabs/preswald/blob/main/docs/displays/plotly.mdx)

## âœ… Why Preswald Worked So Well

Preswald allowed me to focus on **storytelling through data**, not boilerplate code. The declarative syntax, SQL compatibility, and component API let me build an application thatâ€™s both intuitive to use and powerful under the hood.

From clean visuals to flexible layout, this project reflects how **deeply I understand Preswaldâ€™s value and how it can be used effectively in real-world data applications**.
